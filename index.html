                <p>From the moment I met you, something changed in my world. Your smile lights up my darkest days, and your laughter is the sweetest melody I've ever heard.</p>

                <p>Every conversation with you feels like a gift. The way you see the world, your kindness, your strength, your quirks - everything about you makes my heart skip a beat.</p>

                <p>I find myself thinking about you constantly - when I wake up, throughout my day, and as I fall asleep. You've become the brightest part of my life, and I can't imagine my days without you in them.</p>

                <p>I love how you make me want to be a better person. I love how comfortable I feel around you, how I can be completely myself. I love the way my heart races when I see your name pop up on my phone.</p>

                <p>These feelings have been growing stronger every day, and I can't keep them to myself any longer. There's something important I need to ask you...</p>

                <p class="signature">With all my heart,<br>Someone who adores you 💜</p>
